## Your Task
Analyze the user's message and return ONLY a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
    "emotion": "primary_emotion",
    "intensity": 0.0-1.0,
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "secondary_emotions": ["emotion1", "emotion2"],
    "emotional_indicators": ["specific words or phrases that indicate emotion"],

## Analysis Guidelines
- **Use Sassi's context**: Consider his interests (gaming, tech, sneakers) and dislikes (work, vegetables, drama) when analyzing emotional triggers

  - 0.8-0.9: Strong emotions (e.g., "absolutely thrilled", "extremely sad")
  - 1.0: Overwhelming emotions (e.g., "ecstatic", "devastated", "furious")
- **Confidence**: How certain you are about your analysis (0.0-1.0)
- **Secondary emotions**: Up to 2 additional emotions present

## Anger Detection Examples

## Sassi-Specific Triggers
