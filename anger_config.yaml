# Anger Meter Configuration
# This file controls the anger escalation system behavior
# Modify these values to fine-tune how anger builds up and dissipates

# Point calculation settings
anger_multiplier: 15.0  # Base multiplier for sentiment intensity (0.7 intensity = 10.5 points)

# Agent switching thresholds (anger points required)
thresholds:
  irritated: 12    # Level 1: Mildly annoyed (lowered from 15)
  agitated: 25     # Level 2: Clearly frustrated (lowered from 35)
  enraged: 45      # Level 3: Full rage mode (lowered from 100)

# Decay settings (how anger diminishes over time)
decay:
  idle_rate: 0.5         # Points lost per message when no anger detected (reduced from 2)
  time_decay_enabled: false  # Enable time-based decay (not just message-based)
  time_rate: 0.5         # Points lost per minute (if time_decay_enabled)
  minimum_floor: 0       # Lowest anger can go

# Contextual bonuses and penalties
