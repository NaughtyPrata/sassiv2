# Anger Meter Configuration
# This file controls the anger escalation system behavior
# Modify these values to fine-tune how anger builds up and dissipates

# Point calculation settings
anger_multiplier: 15.0  # Base multiplier for sentiment intensity (0.7 intensity = 10.5 points)

# Agent switching thresholds (anger points required) - GRADUAL ESCALATION ENFORCED
thresholds:
  irritated: 20    # Level 1: Mildly annoyed 
  agitated: 45     # Level 2: Clearly frustrated 
  enraged: 80      # Level 3: Full rage mode - high threshold to prevent direct jumps

# Decay settings (how anger diminishes over time)
decay:
  idle_rate: 0.1         # Very slow decay to prevent easy escape from anger states
  time_decay_enabled: false  # Enable time-based decay (not just message-based)
  time_rate: 0.5         # Points lost per minute (if time_decay_enabled)
  minimum_floor: 0       # Lowest anger can go

# Contextual bonuses and penalties - REDUCED to prevent single-message level jumps
bonuses:
  consecutive_anger: 5        # Extra points for back-to-back angry messages
  rapid_escalation: 3         # Bonus when anger builds quickly
  vulgar_language: 8          # Extra points for swearing/offensive language (reduced)
  direct_insults: 12          # Extra points for personal attacks/insults (reduced)
  
penalties:
  apology_reduction: -8       # Points removed when user apologizes (reduced from -15)
  calm_language: -2           # Points removed for peaceful/calm messages (reduced from -5)
  positive_emotion: -5        # Points removed when happiness/joy detected (reduced from -10)

# Meter behavior
meter:
  max_points: 100            # Maximum anger points possible
  escalation_cooldown: 2     # Messages to wait before allowing escalation again
  de_escalation_immediate: true  # Allow immediate de-escalation when anger drops

# De-escalation rules (specific to enraged state)
de_escalation:
  enraged_apology_requirement: 2    # Number of apologies required to allow de-escalation from enraged
  apology_memory_limit: 5           # How many messages to remember apologies for
  reset_apology_count_on_anger: true  # Reset apology count if user gets angry again

# Debug settings
debug:
  show_meter_in_response: true   # Include anger meter info in API responses
  log_point_changes: true        # Log every point change for debugging
